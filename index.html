            <h2>The Man Behind the Picture</h2>
            <p>I am someone who not only understands writing code and websites. I come from a blue-collar construction background in which i excelled. With that experience 
                I am more suited to interpret your needs as a consumer. I can do this because I am in fact a product of both worlds. Most programmers don't know how you want
                your business portrayed to the rest of the world. I am you so therefore I can think in a manner to suite your every need.

        <h2 class="titl">Who am I?</h2>
        <article>
            <p>I'm an aspiring developer who would love an oppurtunity to break out into the world of big tech. Even though I haven't been doing this for long I assure you I have more than enough skills to satisy your needs.
                I have worked on a multitude of projects throughout my bootcamp experience and truly believe I have found my calling. I'm extemely passionate about what I'm doing and have taken extreme measures to achieve
                my goals in life. My current goal is to become a full stack developer and if you're an employer you could make that happen and I would be forever grateful.
                The time I spent in the military has cultivated me into being one of the most loyal people you'll ever meet if given the oppurtunity.
            </p>
